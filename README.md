## Quick-start

The main dependency is nix:

[Installation instructions](https://nixos.org/download.html)
[Enable flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes)

From here, obtain a devshell and work as normal with `cargo`: `nix develop`
Self-supplied cargo tooling may work, but the nix flake is intended as the primary environment for development.
